WeatherRun is the app providing users with current air quality and weather data and provides clothes recommendations based on that data.

* User can type in a city name into the search box on the search page. 
* 5 last searches are displayed on the search page for returning users.
* User can press the "Location arrow" button to get location from device geolocation ( user have to allow for location services ).  
* When user presses search button or return keyboard key or one of remembered searches, site redirects to result page.
* When user presses geolocation button user location is acquired and passed to the fetch function which gets data for location.
* Result Page displays current weather and air quality, 5-day forecast and recommended running clothes.
* User can switch between light and dark mode, choice is applied to all pages and is saved in localStorage, so it is remembered for the next visit.
* User can display data sources by clicking info button in bottom right corner.
